## Features
- TypeScript Interfaces: The code uses TypeScript interfaces to define the structure of the products.
- Price Calculation: A function calculates the price per 100 grams for each product in the list.
- Rounding: The calculated price per 100 grams is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

## Here's how you can use the calcPricePer100g function:

- Define your list of products with the required fields (name, weightInKg, and price).
- Call the calcPricePer100g function, passing in the list of products.
- The function will return an array of products with an additional field per100gPrice, which represents the price per 100 grams.
